Deploying this Quick Start with default parameters builds the following {partner-product-short-name} environment in the
AWS Cloud.

image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/starwind_qs_architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans three Availability Zones.
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound
internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** A Windows bastion host in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound secure
Remote Desktop Gateway (RD Gateway) access to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances in public and private subnets.*
* In the private subnets:
** Two StarWind VSAN EC2 storage instances (nodes 1 and 2) in Availability Zones 1 and 3. These instances—referred to as StarWind highly available (HA) devices—provide virtualized iSCSI (internet Small Computer System Interface) storage with synchronous copies on each instance. These instances run on a Windows Server Failover Cluster.
** A StarWind VSAN EC2 witness instance (node) in Availability Zone 2. This instance monitors the storage instances to ensure quorum in case one of them fails.
** Two iSCSI elastic network interfaces in Availability Zones 1 and 3. These network interfaces give storage clients access to the VSAN storage.
** Three management network interfaces in Availability Zones 1, 2, and 3. These network interfaces give administrators management access to the instances.
** Two synchronization network interfaces in Availability Zones 1 and 3. These network interfaces replicate the storage on the StarWind VSAN storage instances.
